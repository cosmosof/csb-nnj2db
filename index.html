Our Teaching Model is Nature-based , and our learners spend 1/3 of their learning time outdoors. Our Educators' mindset focused on shaping a sustainable learning environment. We offer after school Mathematics, Reading, Calligraphy - Handwriting, Theater & Performance by Children, Foreign Languages sessions. We also offer Daily Show-up Math, Reading, Mindful Play sessions between 10 am - 12 pm and 5 pm - 7 pm: for the latter service no prior sign up needed. <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Our Mission & Vision</h3> 1. To empower children in discovering their unique natural skills through rigorous academics, artistic expression, and emotional development, as wholesome children have a promising potential to contribute to the well being of the world. 2. A wholesome child finds identity, meaning and purpose in life through connecting and developing deeper understanding of the world around them. <p></p> <p> <h7>7 Pillars of Learning</h7> <ul> <li> Nature based - time spent by children in natural environments has numerous psychological benefits. It plays the role of a buffer layer of life stresses, leading to increased resilience (Wells & Evans, 2003). It also leads to decreased stress and aggression and increased attention, and has been shown to reduce the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. These students tend to score higher on tests where concentration and self-discipline are required (Kuo & Faber Taylor, 2002; Kuo & Faber Taylor, 2004; Kuo & Sullivan, 2001). Also, natural environments promote ideal neurological states for learning. Considering all the benefits of outdoors, our children spend ⅓ of time outdoors, trail walks, bird-watching, weather observation and recording, etc. </li> <li> Holistic - rather than just teach, we collaborate with each child and family provide a solid holistic learning environment. For instance, if a child shows excitement for reading, our holistic educator might guide that child to various activities that involve reading - such as assisting in writing child’s own first poem or story, playing theatrical scenes from children’s stories, attending local theaters. </li> <li> STEAM Curriculum - our strong STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Math) Curriculum employs a Multi Sensory approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. Famous Mathematician Fibonacci found the most interesting patterns in nature. He pointed out how elements of nature follow a set of pattern. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso used math extensively in their art. First of all, art adds sensorial dimension to Math. Senses like touching and hearing associated with a simple math problem stimulate different parts of brain. In fact, it is a fabulous learning experience. Concepts like symmetry, space, 2D shapes, 3D shapes, number sensing are easier to understand when learned through art. </li> <li> Play based learning - learning through real life plays such as being a cook, selling home baked cookies, being a gardener, a taylor, a book writer, an architect, a scientist, a politician, a doctor etc. offers that very fascinating experience to be in the shoes of the mentioned careers and professions.</li> <li> Personalized learning - at our school, we believe each child is unique. Each child has something to offer to the classroom. Also, we learn to be patient, understanding, loyal to our values. Our curriculum is designed in a manner that every child should benefit from it to the fullest. </li> <li> Self-discovery - we believe in the Montessori's Cosmic Education where it states every person has a Cosmic Task in this world. Whether it is a tailor or a writer, an architect, a scientist, a president, a priest or an entrepreneur, it is our Cosmic task to be a genuine human being. Finding purpose of learning and life through Cosmic Education is essential. </li> <li> Self-improvement - at our School, we believe in the saying that “Every day is a blessing, it is a chance to be more cooperative, more diligent, more devoted, more focused than I was yesterday.” </li> </ul> </p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM_V1qBxHqaTmxNbh2G_uJjkst2oduHQa6jP02Uuqq-CL9Ig/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schedule your child's Nature-based Learning Journey</a> </div> </div> <footer class="footer"> <span>4400 MacArthur Blvd., Suite #202, NW, Washington, D.C. 20007</span> <span>Georgetown</span> </footer> </body></html>
