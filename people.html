She holds a PhD degree in Microbiology from Boston University and Master's degree in Biotechnology Management from the IE Business School in Spain. Having educated herself in child development after having a child, she strongly believes in the benefits of playing and learning outdoors. Nature-based educational programs support the social, emotional, behavioral and intellectual development of children and need to be widely available (which is sadly not the case). She resides in Bethesda, MD. Among her favorite activities are camping, reading and spending time with loved ones. </p> <p> <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM_V1qBxHqaTmxNbh2G_uJjkst2oduHQa6jP02Uuqq-CL9Ig/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x2709; Schedule your child's Nature-based Learning Journey</a> </p></div> </div> <footer class="footer"> <a class="mail" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM_V1qBxHqaTmxNbh2G_uJjkst2oduHQa6jP02Uuqq-CL9Ig/viewform?embedded=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x2709; </a> <span>4400 MacArthur Blvd., Suite #202, NW, Washington, D.C. 20007</span> <span>Georgetown</span> </footer> </div> </body></html>
