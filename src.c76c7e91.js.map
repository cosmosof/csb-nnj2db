In the early years of child development, it’s critical to surround your child with the most nurturing, predictable, and stable environment.\n    Our core philosophy is about bringing up a child who is cooperating not competing, as competition often makes kids anxious and that interferes with concentration. Second, competition doesn't allow them to share their talents and resources as cooperation does. We learn more through cooperation and, in the real life scenario, we adults work together to complete projects. It’s very vital, to introduce children from their young age that cooperative relationships in workplaces are far more efficient.\n    Mastering Mathematics, learning about Science, Reading, Creative Writing through plays, games and other creative activities are proven to be easy and productive.\n  </p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM_V1qBxHqaTmxNbh2G_uJjkst2oduHQa6jP02Uuqq-CL9Ig/viewform?embedded=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contact Us</a>.  \n    </div>\n  </div>\n<footer class=\"footer\"> \n  <span>4400 MacArthur Blvd NW Suite #202, Washington DC 20007</span>\n  <span>Palisades | Georgetown</span>\n</footer>\n`;\n"]}
