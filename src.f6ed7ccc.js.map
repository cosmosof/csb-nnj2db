It carries a role of a buffer layer of life stresses, leading to increased resilience (Wells & Evans, 2003). It also leads to decreased stress and aggression and increased attention, and has been shown to reduce the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. These students tend to score higher on tests where concentration and self-discipline are required (Kuo & Faber Taylor, 2002; Kuo & Faber Taylor, 2004; Kuo & Sullivan, 2001). Also, natural environments promote ideal neurological states for learning.  Considering all the  benefits of outdoors, our children spend ⅓ of time outdoors, trail walks, bird-watching, weather observation and recording, etc. </li>\n      <li> Holistic - rather than just teach, we collaborate with each child and family provide an solid holistic learning environment. For instance, if a child shows excitement for reading, our holistic educator might guide that child to various activities that involve reading - such as assisting in writing child’s own first poem, playing theatrical scenes from children’s stories, attending local theaters. </li>\n      <li> STEAM school - our strong STEAM Curriculum employs a Multi Sensory approach to teaching  Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. Famous Mathematician Fibonacci found the most interesting patterns in nature. He pointed out how elements of nature follow a set of pattern. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso used math extensively in their art. First of all, art adds sensorial dimension to Math. Senses like touching and hearing associated with a simple math problem stimulate differents parts of brain. In fact, it is a fabulous learning experience. Concepts like symmetry, space, 2D shapes, 3D shapes, number sensing are easier to understand when learned through art. </li>\n      <li> Play based learning - learning through real life plays such as being a cook, selling home baked cookies, being a gardener, a  taylor, a book writer, an architect, a scientist, a politician, a doctor  etc. offers that very fascinating experience to be in the shoes of the mentioned careers and professions.</li>\n      <li> Personalized  learning  - at our school, we believe each child is unique. Each child has something to offer to the classroom. Also, we learn to be patient, understanding, loyal to our values, Our curriculum is designed in a manner that every child should benefit from it to the fullest. </li>\n      <li> Self-discovery - we believe in Cosmic Education where it states every person has a Cosmic Task in this world. Whether it is a tailor or a writer, an architect, a scientist, a president, a priest  or an entrepreneur, it is our Cosmic task to be a genuine human being.  Finding purpose of learning and life through Cosmic Education is essential. </li>\n      <li> Self-improvement -  at our School, we believe  in the saying that  “Every day is a blessing, it is a chance to be more cooperative, more diligent, more devoted, more focused than I was  yesterday.” </li>\n    </ul>\n  </p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM_V1qBxHqaTmxNbh2G_uJjkst2oduHQa6jP02Uuqq-CL9Ig/viewform?embedded=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contact Us</a>.  \n    </div>\n  </div>\n<footer class=\"footer\"> \n  <span>4400 MacArthur Blvd., NW Suite #202, Washington, D.C. 20007</span>\n  <span>Georgetown</span>\n</footer>\n`;\n"]}
